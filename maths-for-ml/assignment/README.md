# Assignments – Maths for ML

This folder contains my assignments on **mathematics, statistics, and probability for machine learning**. This covers:

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, variance, distributions, and data visualization
- **Inferential Statistics & Probability:** Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and probability concepts

Each assignment includes **step-by-step explanations, calculations, and conclusions** to demonstrate my understanding and hands-on application in Python.
