[![Open Anime Recommendation App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-App-green?style=for-the-badge)](YOUR_STREAMLIT_APP_URL_HERE)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds an **Anime Recommendation System** that provides personalized and general recommendations based on **anime ratings, user interactions, and genre similarity**.

The system implements **popularity-based ranking, content-based filtering, and collaborative filtering**, allowing users to explore trending anime, find similar shows, or receive recommendations tailored to their preferences.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

To design a **recommendation system** that helps anime watchers discover anime:

- Based on popularity and community engagement (**Hot & Trending**)  
- Personalized suggestions for a given user (**Collaborative Filtering**)  
- Similar anime based on genre (**Content-Based Filtering**)

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Anime Dataset:** `anime.csv` – contains anime metadata like name, genre, type, rating, episodes, and members.  
- **Ratings Dataset:** `rating.csv` – contains user ratings for anime (`user_id`, `anime_id`, `rating`).  

**Dataset Source:** [Kaggle – Anime Recommendation Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database/data)

---

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked **missing values** and data types.  
- Analyzed **genre distribution**, episode counts, and rating distributions.  
- Visualized **popular anime by members** and **average ratings**.  
- Identified active users and frequently rated anime to optimize memory usage.

---

## 📐 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Filled missing values for `genre`, `type`, `episodes`, and `rating`.  
- Converted numeric columns and handled invalid entries.  
- Aggregated multiple ratings per user-anime pair by taking the **mean**.  
- Normalized and weighted anime scores for popularity-based ranking.

---

## 🤖 Recommendation Approaches

### 1️⃣ Popularity-Based (Hot & Trending)
- Weighted scoring using **ratings and number of members**.  
- Normalized scores to create a **final score** ranking.

### 2️⃣ Content-Based Filtering
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** of genres.  
- Computes **cosine similarity** between anime to recommend similar shows.

### 3️⃣ Collaborative Filtering
- Builds a **user-item interaction matrix**.  
- Computes **item-item similarity** for personalized recommendations.  
- Filters out low-activity users and unpopular anime for memory efficiency.

## 💻 Streamlit Web Application

Interactive **Streamlit app** with three main tabs:

1. **🔥 Hot & Trending:** Shows top-ranked anime by weighted score.  
2. **🎯 Personal Recommendations:** Users input their **User ID** to get collaborative filtering recommendations.  
3. **🤝 Similar Anime:** Users select an anime to see **genre-based similar shows**.  

Features:
- Modern UI with custom CSS  
- Ratings and member count visualization  
- Real-time recommendations without pre-trained models
